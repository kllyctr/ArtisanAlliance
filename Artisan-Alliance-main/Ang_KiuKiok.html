                National Artist for Visual Arts (2001)<br>

                ANG KIUKOK<br><br>
                Born to immigrant Chinese parents Vicente Ang and Chin Lim, Ang Kiukok is one of the most vital and dynamic figures who emerged during the 60s. As one of those who came at the heels of the pioneering modernists during that decade, Ang Kiukok blazed a formal and iconographic path of his own through expressionistic works of high visual impact and compelling meaning.
                <br><br>He crystallized in vivid, cubistic figures the terror and angst of the times. Shaped in the furnace of the political turmoil of those times, Ang Kiukok pursued an expression imbued with nationalist fervor and sociological agenda.
                <br><br>Some of his works include Geometric Landscape (1969); Pieta, which won for him the bronze medal in the 1st International Art Exhibition held in Saigon (1962); and the Seated Figure (1979), auctioned at Sotheby’s in Singapore.
                <br><br>His works can be found in many major art collections, among them the Cultural Center of the Philippines, National Historical Museum of Taipei, and the National Museum in Singapore. Ang Kiukok died on May 9, 2005.

                            Its subject, fishermen reaping their bounty,<br>
                            showed the National Artist’s penchant for portraying the common man<br>
                            in a style that fused cubism with expressionism.<br>
                            Yet more curiously, under a red sun, the three angled forms similarly seem to spell out the artist’s name.<br>
